Note: You can also use the == comparison operator for null checks instead of the != operator. 
When doing so, note that the two bodies are reversed. 
The body of the if branch assumes that the variable is null and the body of the else branch assumes that the variable is non-nullable.



The ?: Elvis operator is an operator that you can use together with the ?. safe-call operator. 
With the ?: Elvis operator, you can add a default value when the ?. safe-call operator returns null. 
It's similar to an if/else expression, but in a more idiomatic way.
If the variable isn't null, the expression before the ?: 
Elvis operator executes. If the variable is null, the expression after the ?: Elvis operator executes
